# Welcome to the DSCTeX Documentation

This package contains LaTeX `.sty` and `.cls` files used in DSC courses at UCSD.

## Installation

The easiest installation involves cloning the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/eldridgejm/dsctex) and copying the files under
the `src/` directory to the same directory containing your LaTeX document.

A more permanent installation involves saving these files somewhere and adding
that directory to the `$TEXINPUTS` environment variable.

## Classes

There are three files in this distribution:

- [`dscslides.cls`](dscslides.md): a document class for the creation of lecture slides
- [`dscproblemset.cls`](dscproblemset.md): for creating sets of problems (and solutions)

## Packages

- [`dscmath.sty`](dscmath.md): symbols and helpers for writing math
