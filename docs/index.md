# Welcome to DSCTeX

This package contains LaTeX `.sty` and `.cls` files used in DSC courses at UCSD.

## Installation

The easiest installation involves copying the files under the `src/` directory
to the same directory containing your LaTeX document.

A more permanent installation involves saving these files somewhere and adding
that directory to the `$TEXINPUTS` environment variable.

## Files

There are three files in this distribution:

- [`dscslides.sty`](dscslides.md): a style file wrapper Beamer for the creation of lecture slides
- [`dscproblemset.cls`](dscproblemset.cls): a class for creating sets of problems (and solutions)
- [`dscexam.cls`](dscexam.cls): a class for creating exams
